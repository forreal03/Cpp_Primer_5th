Use **an unsigned type** when you know that the values cannot be **negative**.

Use int for integer arithmetic. short is usally too small and, in practice,
long often has the same size as int. If your data values are larger than 
the minimum guranteed size of and int, then use long long.

**Do not use plain char or bool in arithmetic expressions.**
Use them only to hold characters or truth values.
Computations using char are especially problematic
because char is **signed on some machines and unsigned on others.**
If you need a tiny integer, explicitly specify either signed char or unsigned char.

Use double for **floating-point computations**;
float usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations
versus single precision is **negligible**.
In fact, on some machines, double-precision operations are faster than single.
The precision offered by long double usually is unnecessary and often entails considerable **run-time** cost.
